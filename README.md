# CryptoClustering
Using Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

Based on visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, using fewer features to cluster the data by using K-means results in tighter grouping for clusters (K-means remains consistent.)
